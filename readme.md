# B64-BOT
## To test this bot you need to enable INLINE MODE in BotFather
## Also you will need to place bot's token in file "token"
1. `Encoding`
This bot _encodes_ like that:
- @name-of-bot text-to-encode
- Button "Encode" will appear, you press it and you get encoded text

2. `Decoding`
This bot _decodes_ like that: 
- Firstly you need to add this bot to your group
- Give him admin rights to delete messages (it is needed to delete decode commands)
- Reply to base64 text with command "/decode"
- You will get your decoded text in PM, but bots aren't allowed to start conversation so text him first
- Bot will delete command "/delete"



###### How idea of this bot came to me
###### @maxim3007 started texting me with base64 saying we should no longer text in human-readable format
###### I started replying him with base64, but it wasn't very comfortable to translate in base64 and back.
###### So, I decided to create a telegram bot for this task.
